            <h2>The idea</h2>
            <p>Recycled tablets get distributed at schools, with a built-in kid-friendly software that makes it easy for the children to submit their opinions about climate change. The process is anonymous and secure, and the opinions are posted to a social media/website run by us.
            </p>
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
            People donate their used tablets that they donâ€™t need anymore.
            The tablets get a software where the children can voice their opinions about climate change anonymously. The software can be used as an education tool with videos etc. informing about what is happening around the world. 
            Used tablets are distributed to children through schools.
            We work with internet providers (Project Loon by Alphabet/LLC) to set up a wi-fi connection in the respective places, a service they provide through CSR
            The children voice their opinion with no more than a click, and we/volunteers post the opinions to the website/other social media so the world can see.
            </p>
            <h2>Financing</h2>
            <p>
            Making deals with multinational telecommunication providers such as Apple and Samsung, offering a chance to give back.
            Both Apple and Samsung offers trade-in services on their devices, where the customer receives a small amount for their old devices. 
            We offer to better the Corporate Social Responsibility of these companies by offering a program where they can give returned devices to children who need a channel to express their concerns about climate change. 
            So in addition to people donating their old devices to TellTab directly, telecommunication providers donate a part of their trade-in program instead of selling them.
